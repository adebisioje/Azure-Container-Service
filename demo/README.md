# Azure-Container-Service Demo 

Here you would find a number of folders that represent demos. If you are new to container services, you should start out with demo 1. Before you start, please follow the instructions below: 

# Requirements

* Docker Download(Mac): https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/
* Docker Download (Windows): https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/
* Docker Download (linux - Ubuntu): https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/

Others can be found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/ under install

PS: I would be running most of my commands on a Mac OS for this demo. Similar commands can be run on windows as well. 

#Test installed docker on machine
To test if docker is installed, type the following in your console:

    * which docker 
   
 Result
 
    * adebisioje$ which docker
    * /usr/local/bin/docker

Now you can start on the demos!
